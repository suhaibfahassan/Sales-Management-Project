-- My Manager 'Alex' has emailed me with a specific task to complete by the end of the week --

Alex  - Sales Manager:

Hi Suhaib!

I hope you are doing well. We need to improve our internet sales reports and want to move from static information to visual dashboards.

Essentially, we want to focus it on how much we have sold of what products, to which clients and how it has been over time.

Seeing as each salesperson works on different products and customers it would be beneficial to be able to filter them also.

We measure our numbers against budget so I added that in a spreadsheet so we can compare our values against performance. 

The budget is for 2023 and we usually look 2 years back when we do sales analysis.

Let me know if you need anything else!


-- Key Takeaways from this email --

1) How much we sold of distinct products
2) To which clients did we sell them to
3) Progress over that period of time
4) Filter each salesperson and the different products and customers they work on
5) Focus budget on years 2021-2023
